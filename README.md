# Swami-Chinmayananda-s-Gita-Translations-Sentiment-Semantic-Analysis
Religious texts, especially those with profound philosophical content like the Bhagavad Gita, hold immense significance in shaping spiritual and ethical beliefs. Swami Chinmayananda's translation of the Bhagavad Gita offers a unique perspective that has inspired millions worldwide. In this study, we leverage modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis and semantic embedding models, to gain insights into the emotional and semantic layers of this sacred text.

Despite the availability of translations and interpretations, sentiment analysis and semantic understanding of religious texts have been limited. Sentiment analysis can reveal the emotional tone of the verses, while semantic analysis can uncover deeper meanings and interrelationships between verses. The goal of this study is to apply these modern NLP techniques to explore the emotional and philosophical content of Swami Chinmayanandaâ€™s translation of the Bhagavad Gita.
